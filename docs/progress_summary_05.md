## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Configuration Files
```
android/app/google-services.json          # Firebase configuration
android/build.gradle.kts                  # Project-level Firebase plugin
android/app/build.gradle.kts             # App-level Firebase implementation
```

### Key Gradle Configuration Changes
```kotlin
// Project-level build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.2" apply false
}

// App-level build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")  // Added
}
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.15.0"))
}
```

### Version Management Pattern
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
version: 1.0.0+1  # Format: major.minor.patch+buildNumber
```

### Package Name Resolution
- **Changed from**: `com.example.magiceatz`
- **Changed to**: `com.bluevista.magiceatz`
- **Fixed in**: `build.gradle.kts` namespace and applicationId

## üîß Lessons Learned

### Firebase Setup Complexity
- **App Distribution appears only after** app registration is complete in Firebase Console
- **Package name consistency is critical** - must match exactly between Firebase registration and build configuration
- **Kotlin DSL syntax differs** from Groovy - parentheses vs quotes matter in `.kts` files

### Flutter Release Build Challenges
- **NDK version mismatches** are common with multiple plugins requiring specific versions
- **Release builds fail differently** than debug builds - package name issues only surface in release
- **Error messages can be misleading** - ClassNotFoundException often indicates configuration issues, not missing code

### Debugging Strategies
- **Android Studio Logcat** is essential for diagnosing mobile app crashes
- **Real device testing** provides more accurate error information than emulators
- **Package name verification** should be done early in the setup process
- **Clean rebuilds** are often necessary after configuration changes

### Version Management Best Practices
- **Increment build number** (+1) for each test distribution
- **Use semantic versioning** (major.minor.patch) for user-facing releases
- **Firebase tracks by versionCode** - build number determines revision tracking
- **Version consistency** between pubspec.yaml and build files is automatic when properly configured

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps
