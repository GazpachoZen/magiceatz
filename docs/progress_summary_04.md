# Session Progress Summary - Flutter Camera Integration & Lambda Vision Support

**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Focus**: Completing camera image analysis integration between Flutter app and ChatGPT Lambda

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Flutter App URL Fix
- **Identified camera analysis bug**: Flutter app was calling wrong Lambda URL (database instead of ChatGPT)
- **Fixed `AnalysisScreen.dart`**: Changed from `xnqnu6lmktrqrc3e6scmqpo4ya0ctehg` (database) to `dqpnq7moojw3umxxacbazmzvam0sujff` (ChatGPT)
- **Single line fix**: Only URL needed to be corrected, request payload was already properly structured

### ‚úÖ Lambda Vision Support Implementation
- **Extended ChatGPT Lambda** with dual-mode capability: regular chat + vision analysis
- **Request type routing**: Detects `type: 'vision'` parameter to switch between modes
- **OpenAI Vision API integration**: Properly formatted base64 image requests to `gpt-4o` model
- **Performance optimization**: Used `detail: 'low'` and reduced `max_tokens` for faster responses
- **Increased Lambda timeout**: From 3 seconds to 30 seconds to accommodate vision processing time

### ‚úÖ CORS Configuration Resolution
- **Diagnosed duplicate CORS headers**: AWS Lambda Function URLs + manual headers caused browser rejection
- **Streamlined approach**: Removed all manual CORS headers from Lambda code
- **Let AWS handle CORS**: Function URL CORS configuration manages cross-origin requests automatically
- **Fixed both chat and vision**: Both web chat and Flutter image analysis now work properly

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Lambda Architecture Enhancement
```javascript
// Main handler with request type detection
if (body.type === 'vision') {
  return await handleVisionRequest(body);
} else {
  return await handleChatRequest(body);
}
```

### Vision Request Processing
- **Model**: `gpt-4o` for optimal vision capabilities
- **Image format**: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64Image}`
- **Detail level**: `low` for faster processing
- **Token limit**: 300 tokens for concise responses
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with detailed logging

### Chat Request Processing
- **Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` for regular conversations
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing web chat functionality unchanged
- **Response validation**: Proper checking of choices array and content length

## üîß Lessons Learned

### AWS Lambda Function URLs & CORS
- **Automatic CORS handling**: Function URLs provide built-in CORS support when configured
- **Avoid duplicate headers**: Manual CORS headers conflict with AWS automatic headers
- **Browser vs Native**: CORS only affects browser requests, not native mobile apps
- **Error manifestation**: Duplicate headers cause "multiple values" error in browser console

### Vision API Integration Best Practices
- **Model selection matters**: `gpt-4o` performs better than `gpt-4o-mini` for vision tasks
- **Timeout requirements**: Vision requests typically take 10-15 seconds vs 1-2 for chat
- **Image detail optimization**: `low` detail provides good results with faster processing
- **Base64 format specificity**: Must include proper MIME type prefix for OpenAI API

### Flutter-Lambda Communication
- **URL accuracy critical**: Small endpoint mistakes cause complete feature failure
- **Request payload validation**: Ensure client and server expect same data structure
- **Error propagation**: Lambda errors should provide meaningful feedback to mobile UI
- **Performance considerations**: Mobile users expect quick responses for camera features

### Lambda Development Strategy
- **Multi-purpose functions**: Single Lambda handling related operations reduces complexity
- **Request type routing**: Clean separation of different API modes within same function
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed console logs essential for debugging complex interactions
- **Timeout planning**: Set timeouts based on slowest operation the Lambda will handle
