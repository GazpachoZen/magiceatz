I am creating a satirical health food web site and related app called MagicEatz.

The fundamental thought is that a diet filled with high-salt and greasy food will 
cure someone of a completely fictional disease we will make up. The web/app for
MagicEatz will need the following...
- the app is a thin client to content hosted on our web site. It will be written in Flutter
- there is a backend database hosted on AWS for account management
- there needs to be a chat function for coaching users and providing motivation, handled through API calls to ChatGPT.
- the app must be able to access the phone's camera for scanning bar codes, reading menus to make recommendations, and as a new feature to look at food label content to see how well it rates on our special high-salt, high-grease regimen. This will call over to either ChatGPT if it is a menu or food label, or do a database lookup if it is a barcode.

I will be doing the bulk of the software here in Claude. This will include the following...
- Creating the React based pages. After being templated out and well formatted, I will create the content.
- The refinement of CSS to achieve a desired look and feel that works well on both computer web browsers and phones.
- Creating of database schema and early population.
