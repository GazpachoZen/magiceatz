I am creating a satirical health food web site and related app called MagicEatz.

The fundamental thought is that a diet filled with high-salt and greasy food will 
cure someone of a completely fictional disease we will make up. The web/app for
MagicEatz will need the following...
- the app is a thin client to content hosted on our web site. It will be written in Flutter
- there is a backend database hosted on AWS for account management
- there needs to be a chat function for coaching users and providing motivation, handled through API calls to ChatGPT.
- the app must be able to access the phone's camera for scanning bar codes, reading menus to make recommendations, and as a new feature to look at food label content to see how well it rates on our special high-salt, high-grease regimen. This will call over to either ChatGPT if it is a menu or food label, or do a database lookup if it is a barcode.

I will be doing the bulk of the software here in Claude. This will include the following...
- Creating the React based pages. After being templated out and well formatted, I will create the content.
- The refinement of CSS to achieve a desired look and feel that works well on both computer web browsers and phones.
- Creating of database schema and early population.

Preferences/constraints...
- For situations where we have a several steps, each relying on completion of the prior, supply them only one at a time and await confirmation of success before providing the next step.
- I welcome modifications that might require multiple steps, understanding that these are sometimes warranted. When that happens, I prefer that you show them to me one file at a time. I do NOT want a blitz of file modifications to be shown as a single output from you. 
- If modifications to a file are modest, show them to me with instructions on where to make the edits. If the modifications are extensive, ask me if I'd prefer to have you provide the full file.
- When generating TypeScript code, always make it compliant with lint rules.
- Always give a critical eye to things I might suggest. If there are down-sides to my ideas, we should discuss them up front.
